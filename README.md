# Crisis360
Crisis360-:This is a software platform that promisingly changes the face of disaster response by bringing flows of data from drones, emergency teams, and weather systems into one pooling, real-time dashboard. A 360-degree view of disaster zones can coordinate faster, safer, and more reliable operations.
-Some of the Key Features of the software are:
a) Real-time Integration: Combines live drone feeds, ground reports, and weather updates for situational awareness.
b) AI Insights: Uses machine learning to optimize relief efforts and resource allocation.
c) User-Friendly Interface: Interactive maps and annotated imagery enhance decision-making.
